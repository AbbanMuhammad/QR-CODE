### What I learned
I learned a lot from this project, amongst which are:

- I know how to use emmet in VS code
- I also learned some HTML elements like
```html
<em></em>
<div></div>
```
- Likewise, I learned some CSS properties:
```css
.box-shadow{
  box-shadow: ;
  text-shadow: ;
}
}
```

### Useful resources

- [CSS Trick](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/) - This helped me a lot whenever I want to know how to use any CSS property. I really liked it.
- [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is an amazing site which helped me understand HTML elements. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
